Project Title: "My First Microgame"

Description: Briefly describe your game and customization.
I changed 2 things. One of them being  

Setup Instructions: How to open and run your game.
There are no instrutions to open the game

Reflection: 50-100 words on what you learned, what worked well, and any challenges.
Something that I learned was that you can open all of the individivle files and modify anything how ever you want.
Something that worked well was the four head bot, because all I had to do was group it. A challenge was the disc lancher,
becuse after I modified the gun, I had to figerout how to actully get it into the game for me to use.
